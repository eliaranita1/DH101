        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Narrative</h1>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Background:</h2>
        <p1>
            <pre>
                        Airbnb started in 2017 with two hosts and three guests, and flourished into a multi-billion dollar
                franchise that now boasts 900 million guest arrivals in most countries (Airbnb). Because Airbnb is
                such a widespread, rapidly-growing service, there has yet to be extensive research about the effects
                of its introduction to the housing market. Our project explores the local conditions of Airbnb in
                Los Angeles, California by analyzing publicly available data compiled from the Airbnb website,
                including a 1-year availability calendar and review details of rental listings. We examine the geographic
                distribution of Airbnb listings and prices within the city, in order to discover how this novel rental
                service is impacting the economy and integrity of the Los Angeles community. Our dataset comes from the
                Inside Airbnb website, an independent and non-commercial project founded by Murray Cox. Through the
                analysis of this data set, we seek to analyze the effects of Airbnb on urban cities, specifically in
                the Los Angeles area.
    
                        Existing literature initially began as a counter-investigation to many of the studies conducted by
                Airbnb itself. In the time following its conception, Airbnb enjoyed success and quickly became a
                poster-child in the newly emerging “share economy” (Gurran 2017). Much of Airbnb’s research concluded
                that the site allows for expansion of the tourism market. Independent research, however, has found
                different conclusions, namely that Airbnb exacerbates problems that are already present in large cities,
                namely the displacement of permanent housing and maintaining affordability. As such, Airbnb allows
                tourism to penetrate residential neighborhoods, often leading to negative consequences with which cities’
                legislation and infrastructure are not equipped to deal (Lee 2016).
                Many investigations have concluded that Airbnb puts hotel and housing markets at risk, especially
                impacting the top markets in the United States, projecting that its influence would continue to grow
                (Lane 2016). There is an absence of any longitudinal tracking of Airbnb’s effects, so the question
                remains of the extent to which Airbnb has become a force of change in the hotel and housing markets.
                Additionally, it is difficult to deny that Airbnb has in some ways affected these markets, but the
                qualitative nature of its effects remain to be investigated. Because Los Angeles is a large market
                economy in the United States, we seek to explore the neighborhoods within the Los Angeles area that
                have been most affected by Airbnb, and what factors might predict a neighborhood’s risk of being impacted
                by Airbnb’s growth.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Significance:</h2>
        <p1>
            <pre>
                        Airbnb is often perceived as a modern solution to tourist housing that provides convenience and flexibility
                in traveling. Its positive perception in the tourist community often masks its negative impacts on housing
                markets. Our project seeks to inform people of the “hidden” effects of Airbnb, an intention especially
                relevant to those who live in the Los Angeles area, which is the focus of our project. Through research and
                data analysis, we examine the complex relationships between Airbnb, its customers, and the local Los Angeles
                community. This involves taking a closer look at where Airbnb listings are concentrated within the city, and
                how their location and other factors affect prices. We would like to uncover the qualities of neighborhoods
                that are at risk of being affected by Airbnb so that urban planners and legislative bodies can dedicate
                efforts to protecting the housing markets in high-risk neighborhoods.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Methodology:</h2>
        <p1>
            <pre>
                        Our methodology is one that is conducted independent of Airbnb itself or bodies associated with the hotel
                markets. Our project is one that seeks to investigate Airbnb in a humanitarian sense. We focus on how Airbnb
                affects the neighborhoods in which we all live, and how its presence can have effects that touch even those
                who do not use Airbnb. Additional attention is given to the way that information about Airbnb is documented
                and perceived, and how this may create silences in the data.
