    About the data
</h1>

<p1>
    <pre style= "margin-left: 10%;">
        
        The Inside Airbnb site is an independent and non-commercial project founded by Murray Cox, a digital 
storyteller and community activist, as well as various volunteers. Inside Airbnb is not affiliated with 
Airbnb nor any of its competitors; the dataset was created to open up public discussion about the effects 
of short-term rentals on residential communities, as well as advocate for policies that protect cities 
from the negative effects of Airbnb. The dataset uses publicly available information compiled from the 
Airbnb website, including a 1-year availability calendar and review details of rental listings. Our team 
is using data from August 2020 to August 2021 in our visualizations and analyses. The site states that 
the data has already been cleaned, analyzed, and combined by the creators.
        The Airbnb data provides different types of sets detailing listings, calendar, and review data. 
When looking at the listings data, basic categories like location, neighborhood overview, stay details, 
and price are shared, along with host information like acceptance and response rate. This information 
allows us to analyze how Airbnb is affecting society geographically and temporally. For instance, we can 
visualize how availability and prices are distributed across Los Angeles, or which areas are receiving 
the most traffic from Airbnb based on review volume. This data analysis can supplement narratives about 
how business from Airbnb is affecting local neighborhoods, and which ones are benefitting most.
        Another important insight can be drawn from this dataset regarding the parties that are benefiting 
from Airbnb services. Some hosts use Airbnb in its original method of home-sharing, living in the 
properties they are renting to guests. Other hosts use Airbnb in a “business-like” manner, renting out 
entire properties similarly to hotels. These types of listings are seen as potential threats to the 
economy and integrity of local communities, as they can cause neighborhood disruptions, take away housing, 
and promote gentrification. We can use the Airbnb dataset to quantify this narrative by looking at the 
percentages of types of listings such as “entire home,” indicating that the host is not living on the 
premises of the rental property.
        Because the data is sourced only from publicly available information provided by the Airbnb 
website, inevitably some sensitive details of the hosts, customers, and listings are not collected. For 
instance, the listings data doesn’t include demographic and socioeconomic information about customers or 
hosts like age, race, income, and gender identity. These holes could create limitations in the research 
questions that can be raised about the impact of Airbnb on different demographics. Additionally, there 
are silences within the given data, such as listings without any reviews. These data points can create 
difficulties when assessing the actual traffic of Airbnb guests. Questions about globalization and travel 
may also be limited by the absence of information about the stays, such as the purpose of bookings and 
where customers are coming from.
        Another complication in the analysis of this dataset is that only the previous twelve months’ 
worth of data are shared. Therefore, it is difficult to illuminate long-term trends or compare different 
time periods with this data. For example, investigating the effects of COVID-19 on tourism by looking at 
the Airbnb data might not prove effective because the readily-available data only goes back to one year 
ago. For similar reasons, it might be hard to predict how tourism might change in the future at the end of 
the pandemic. 
        Finally, the creation of the dataset itself could create inherent biases in our analysis. Inside 
Airbnb “provides a platform to support advocacy for appropriate and effective policies to protect our 
cities from the impacts of short-term rentals,” according to the website. The mission statement frames the 
data with the lens that Airbnb negatively affects communities, which can create bias in the data analysis. 
Inside Airbnb also controls the way in which the data is collected and categorized, which controls what 
types of analyses and visualizations can be produced. In addition, there is little information about how 
data is collected for the Inside Airbnb website, which could be an issue regarding the validity of data 
that is being collected and used by the public. The code for data collection was stated to be “copy and 
pasted” Python code.  While the author provided a Github link for the code, the page seems to no longer 
be in service, which makes it difficult to guarantee the quality of the data. In our project, we mainly 
use this data to qualitatively look at general patterns across Los Angeles, in order to mitigate the 
effect of any small inconsistencies in the data.
