                    Data on Airbnb listings comes from the Inside Airbnb database provided by Murray Cox 
            and colleagues. This source provides comprehensive information about each Airbnb rental, such 
            as price, availability, and room type that have been analyzed, cleansed, and aggregated by the 
            authors of the dataset. These files were then used by our team to create visualizations and 
            analyses. We also relied on scholarly, peer-reviewed sources as well as case studies to get a 
            better understanding of the extent of Airbnb on the housing market within large cities such as 
            New York and Los Angeles.

                    The summary and metrics for listings in the Los Angeles area were exported from the 
            Inside Airbnb website and visualized according to our specific research inquiries. The 
            latitude and longitude data were especially important for the creation of various maps that 
            display our specific narrative. These maps as well as various charts and graphs were designed 
            on Tableau. We chose to utilize these softwares due to their accessibility and easy user 
            experience, allowing for all team members to quickly create data visualization. In addition, 
            the various options for visual representations on Tableau was helpful in accommodating the 
            wide range of data types for our project.

                    Our website was designed using HTML and JavaScript and hosted through the Humspace 
            domain provided by the University of California, Los Angeles. It was our goal when 
            conceptualizing the design for this project that the format of our site mirrors the layout 
            that Airbnb uses so as to create a link between our work and Airbnb. The header was kept 
            simple with red letters contrasting against a white background for users to easily navigate 
            between each of our topics. Overall, we aimed to create a website that was easy to navigate 
            while emulating a similar atmosphere to Airbnb’s design.
