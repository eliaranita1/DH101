    <div class="analysis">
        <p>For my map I have plotted all of the Airbnb listings within Los Angeles County. I have also used Geojson
            data from our dataset to delineate the different cities/neighborhoods within LA. If you hover the mouse over
            an area it will tell you the name of the neighborhood in the info panel at the top right of the map. If you
            click within that area it will zoom into that neighborhood. When
            you click
            the markers for the individual listings it will show the listing info along with a photograph which links to
            the
            actual listing on the Airbnb site.
        <p>
        <p>The data shown includes price, rating, and also location which can provide a better visual understanding of
            where the majority of listings are and their relative prices. It is clear by looking at the map that there
            are much more listings in west LA than there are on the
            eastside, with downtown being a boundary between the densely packed listings and the more spread out ones.
            This makes sense considering
            that, in general, west LA tends to be higher income areas where people might have more resources to own
            income properties. From the map we can
            also compare listings to their proximity to tourist attractions, schools, airports, etc.. to try to find
            patterns.
