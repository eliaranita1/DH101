<p>This visualization shows the vast differences in the cost of Airbnb rooms in the different neighborhoods of Los Angeles.
    It is clear that the more affluent neighborhoods have drastically more expensive listings but they aren't the only places
    offering rooms. I was actually surprised to see the amount of listings in neighborhoods that are relatively low income
    and have higher crime rates but the data seems to show that they too can make money through Airbnb. Some of the price 
    data may be slightly skewed due to smaller neighborhoods having very few listings and/or 1 listing that is priced significantly 
    higher than the rest. This could be useful for homeowners considering building ADUs for the purposes of Airbnb rentals
    to see what typical pricing is in their area and whether it makes financial sense for them.
